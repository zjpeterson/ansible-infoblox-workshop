# ansible-infoblox-workshop

## Introduction
This is a workshop to give hand-on experience with the fundamentals of integrating Infoblox IPAM with Ansible Automation Platform. The ideal audience has intermediate level Ansible experience, as the basics of Ansible/AAP are not covered here. The standard RHEL or Network workshops would be good prerequisite experience.
